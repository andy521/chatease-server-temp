This is a server-side sample project for [chatease](https://github.com/studease/chatease), using spring-websocket.


## Build & Run

> You may have an user login system, and need to control the chatting behavior. Then supply an interface to verify and return the user info.

> To have a quick test, make the userinfo.json file available from [http://localhost:81/websocket/userinfo.json](https://github.com/studease/chatease-server/blob/master/userinfo.json).
